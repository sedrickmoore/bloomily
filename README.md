# Bloomily

**Bloomily** is a personal plant management app designed to help me (and eventually others) track and care for plants more intentionally.

### Features (Planned + In Progress)

- View and search all plants you’ve interacted with — past and present
- Add and update details like watering needs, sunlight zone, soil type, and personal notes
- Track current plants by location (e.g., “Front Patio”, “Balcony”) and see light compatibility
- Log when you last watered a plant and get smart watering reminders
- Create and manage plant “sites” (like “My Apartment” or “Mom’s Garden”) with zone-specific microclimates
- Shared plant spaces — collaborate with another user to manage shared zones
- Mobile-first experience with Android + iOS support
- Future: Web + Desktop versions (React Native + Tauri)
- Future: Integrate with weather data based on location
- Future: Use AI/ML to identify plants via photo

### Tech Stack

- React Native (Expo Dev Client)
- Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS)
- Python (for backend scripts & future ML)

More updates coming soon!
